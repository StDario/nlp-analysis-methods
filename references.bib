		  learners who need to discover both structure and meaning

		  that our model indeed learns to predict features of the
		  visual context given phonetically transcribed image
		  descriptions, and show that it represents linguistic
		  information in a hierarchy of levels: lower layers in the
		  stack are comparatively more sensitive to form, whereas
		  higher layers are more sensitive to meaning.},

  abstract	= {Deep latent variable models, trained using variational
		  autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, are now a
		  key technique for representation learning of continuous
		  structures. However, applying similar methods to discrete
		  structures, such as text sequences or discretized images,
		  has proven to be more challenging. In this work, we propose
		  a more flexible method for training deep latent variable
		  models of discrete structures. Our approach is based on the
		  recently proposed Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) which
		  formalizes adversarial autoencoders as an optimal transport
		  problem. We first extend this framework to model discrete
		  sequences, and then further explore different learned
		  priors targeting a controllable representation. Unlike many
		  other latent variable generative models for text, this
		  adversarially regularized autoencoder (ARAE) allows us to
		  generate fluent textual outputs as well as perform
		  manipulations in the latent space to induce change in the
		  output space. Finally we show that the latent
		  representation can be trained to perform unaligned textual
		  style transfer, giving improvements both in automatic
		  measures and human evaluation.}
